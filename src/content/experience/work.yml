    Created SEKER, a browser-based, backend-less runner for Python/Source programs on the LEGO SPIKE Prime, a MicroPython-based board, complete with Source language bindings for the SPIKE's internal Python API.

    Following the discontinuation of the EV3, SEKER future-proofs the Source Academy robotics curriculum, using an interface that is generalisable to most boards that can run Python. SEKER is already being used in academic activities overseas.

    * Improved security of Source Academy's robotics (EV3) workflow
    * Modernised part of the frontend to React functional components
